# Stamp Duty Calculator

This is a UK residential Stamp Duty Calculator.

Calculating stamp duty can prove a little tricky. For example if you are purchasing a property for £800,000 the first £125,000 you are taxed 0%. Then between £125,001 - £250,000 it is 2%, between £250,000 and £925,000 the rate is 5%.

£0-£125,000	    0%

£125,001-£250k	2%

£250,001-£925k	5%

£925,001-£1.5m	10%

£1.5m+	        12%

The maths is fairly fiddly. The amount you would be charged is: £30,000 with an effective rate of 3.8%.

If this is a second purchase you incur an additional 3%. The amount would then be £46,500 with an effective rate of 5.8%.
